# PopQuizzer

I created this multiple choice quiz with three levels of difficulty and nine categories for my second milestone project whilst studying with the Code Institute. The site features one page with subsuquent sections being added dynamically rather than loading new pages.

The aim of the site is to provide the user with a fun, interactive quiz experience that they can tailor to their intersets and knowledge level.

## Wireframe Files

One wireframe for each device - phone, table and PC were created, one for each section of the home, quiz and endgame pages. The wireframes can be found [here](https://github.com/FiachraCI/popquizzer/blob/main/assets/images/desktop_home-merged.pdf)
